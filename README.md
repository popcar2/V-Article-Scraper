# V-Article-Scraper
A very simple program that scrapes articles and outputs its contents in a .txt file. Only websites that are [in the database](https://github.com/popcar2/V-Article-Scraper/blob/main/db.json) are supported since each website has its own layout.

The purpose of this project is more about me learning V and less about making a working, viable product. You shouldn't be using this in any serious capacity (sorry).

The end goal is to have an automatic way to find and extract article contents for a large variety of websites.

## How to use
Run the program with `v run .`, paste the article link, and voila. You should have the article's contents copied to a .txt file.
