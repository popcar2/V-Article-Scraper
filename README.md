# V-Article-Scraper
A very simple program that scrapes articles and outputs its contents in a .txt file. Right now it only works on IGN articles, but can work with others with some tuning. The end goal is to have an automatic way to find and extract article contents.
The purpose of this project is more about learning V and less about making a working, viable product. You shouldn't be using this in any serious capacity (sorry).

## How to use
Run the program, paste the link, and you should have the article copied to a .txt file.
